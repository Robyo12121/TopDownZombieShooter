Goal:

Mob can detect player based on the speed at which the player moves.
If the player is sprinting the mob's detect radius is bigger. 
If the player is walking the mob's detect radius is smaller. 

Once the player is detected however, the mob will chase the player. 
To escape, the player must move outside a larger radius. 

If the player does this, the mob should move to the last known position of
the player.


# Alerted:
	Move towards player
	if player farther than mob_lose_detection radius:
		Set alerted = False
		Take last known pos of player and move towards that instead.
		
# Not alerted:
	if player comes within radius:
		become alerted
		
		
Flow:
	Player outside Mob's detect radius
	Player moves inside detect radius and mob becomes alerted
	Mob begins to move to player's current (constantly updated) position
