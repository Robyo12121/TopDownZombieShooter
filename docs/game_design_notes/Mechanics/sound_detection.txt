In order to allow the zombie to hear the player when he does an action.

Each player action should have a sound cost associated with it. 

When the player does this action the player's sound cost increases. 

A messaging system will then message nearby zombies to inform nearby entites of 
the sound. 

This system could be used in a multiplayer scenario to allow other players to 
hear an action. 




Simplest way to implement:

Define a sound radius around the player for every action the player does. 
If he shoots a gun his sound radius increases temporarily. If there are zombies within 
that radius they will be alerted. 
That's doing it on the player side though, which probably makes sense.
