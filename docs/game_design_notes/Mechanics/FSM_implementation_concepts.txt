Questions:

What are the global states for?
To avoid ending up with duplicate code in every state. 
For states that could occur at any time, regardless of the current state of the
entity. So, instead of having to define a path from all states to some other state
and writing that into every state definition class, you can define a global state#
that can be reached from any other state. 
Eg. Sims - the sim can go to the bathroom at any time, regardless of what it is
currently doing. Do this by defining the bathroom state as a global state. 
This keeps the logic for going to the bathroom out of every other state. 



Do I need to have unique identifiers (ints) for all entities?
