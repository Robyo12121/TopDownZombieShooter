Design of Zombie AI - states for Finite State Machine. 

Idle
Doesn't detect a target.
Hasn't been recently chasing the player.

Should wander around at a slow pace, in no particular direction, walking speed, 
sometimes standing etc.

Go to aggro state if sees/hears player or direct player action
go to suspicious state is sees indirect player action (throwing stone?)

Aggro
Sees or hears the player or other entity (animals, NPC survivors etc)
Hears an entities action (gunshot or whatever)

Go to suspicious sate if lost player los.

Suspicious
Recently chasing a target but lost site of it.

Should move to last known player point and move around a bit in different directions
to see if it can find the player again. 
IF not, go back to idle/wander state.
